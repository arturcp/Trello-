# Trello ++

This chrome extension adds new features to Trello. Given a set of rules, it will
iterate and apply them in your board.

It currently adds these features:

* [x] Add a card when the current date is in a range of valid dates. It is
useful to be reminded of bills or taxes to pay, or recurrent events that you
need to attend to but never remember to look in the calendar.

Possible new features:

* [ ] Create a configuration page to allow rules to be created dynamically, and
also to let users choose the board on which the rules will be applied.
* [ ] Add an icon and a favicon.
